# CppTowerOfHanoi

## Description
TowerOfHanoi is a C++ application that solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a recursive algorithm. This project demonstrates key programming concepts including recursion, problem-solving techniques, and command-line input handling. The program calculates and displays the steps required to solve the puzzle based on the number of disks provided.

## Features
- Recursive Solution: Implements the Tower of Hanoi algorithm to solve the puzzle.
- Command-Line Interface: Allows users to input the number of disks and view the solution steps.
- Step-by-Step Output: Displays each move required to transfer disks from the source peg to the destination peg.
